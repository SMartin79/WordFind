  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 11, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you use
    <strong>Word Find Connect</strong> (the “App”). The App is developed and published by
    <strong>SteveGamesInc</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) and is available on Google Play.
  </p>
  <p>
    By installing or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>We aim to collect as little personal information as possible while still operating and improving the App.</p>

  <h4>1.1 Information You Provide</h4>
  <p>
    In most cases, you can use the App without giving us any information directly. However, you may choose to
    provide information when you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact us by email for support or feedback.</li>
    <li>Send us bug reports or suggestions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any information you include in such messages (for example, your name or email address) is provided voluntarily
    by you.
  </p>

  <h4>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h4>
  <p>
    When you use the App, certain information may be collected automatically through third-party services
    integrated into the App. This information may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (such as device model, operating system version, language, and region).</li>
    <li>Anonymous identifiers such as the advertising ID.</li>
    <li>In-game events (for example, levels played, session length, and features used).</li>
    <li>Crash and performance data (for example, where and when the App crashed).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is typically used in aggregated or anonymized form and does not allow us to identify you
    personally.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Third-Party Services We Use</h3>
  <p>
    We use trusted third-party services for advertising and analytics. These services may collect and process data
    as described below, and they operate under their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h4>2.1 Google AdMob (Advertising)</h4>
  <p>
    The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to show ads. AdMob may collect and use the following types of data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID and other device identifiers.</li>
    <li>Approximate location (such as country or region).</li>
    <li>Device and usage information (such as app usage, interactions with ads).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data may be used to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Serve and measure ads in the App.</li>
    <li>Limit the number of times you see the same ad.</li>
    <li>Help detect and prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can control the use of the advertising ID in your device settings (for example, by resetting it or turning
    off interest-based ads where available).
  </p>

  <h4>2.2 Unity Analytics</h4>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Unity Analytics</strong> to understand how players use the App and to improve gameplay and
    performance. Unity Analytics may collect:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (model, OS version, language, region).</li>
    <li>In-game events and usage patterns (such as levels completed, time spent in the App).</li>
    <li>Technical information (such as crashes, errors, and performance data).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This helps us understand which features are used, how often the game is played, and where problems occur so we
    can improve the experience.
  </p>

  <h3>3. How We Use the Information</h3>
  <p>We use the information collected to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Operate and maintain the App.</li>
    <li>Improve gameplay, balance, and user experience.</li>
    <li>Show, measure, and improve advertising in the App.</li>
    <li>Identify and fix crashes, bugs, and performance issues.</li>
    <li>Respond to your support requests and feedback.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Legal Basis and International Use</h3>
  <p>
    We are based in Canada. Depending on your location, data may be processed in Canada, the United States, or
    other countries where our third-party providers operate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where applicable (for example, in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom), we rely on the following
    legal bases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide and operate the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to improve and protect the App and to prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for personalized advertising or certain analytics where required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Children’s Privacy</h3>
  <p>
    The App is designed for a <strong>general audience</strong> and is not specifically directed at children under
    the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction).
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If you are a parent or guardian
    and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to
    remove that information.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
  <p>
    We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer
    retention period is required or allowed by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third-party providers such as Google AdMob and Unity Analytics keep data according to their own retention
    policies.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Security</h3>
  <p>
    We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information processed through the App.
    However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Your Choices and Rights</h3>
  <p>You may have certain rights over your data depending on your location, such as the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request access to data related to you.</li>
    <li>Request correction or deletion of data where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain types of processing.</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise these rights, you can contact us using the details below. We may ask for information to verify your
    identity before responding.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also control certain settings directly on your device, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Resetting or limiting your advertising ID.</li>
    <li>Managing app permissions in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the
    top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes means you accept the updated Policy.
  </p>
